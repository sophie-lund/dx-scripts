[![CI](https://github.com/sophie-lund/dx-scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sophie-lund/dx-scripts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

DX Scripts is a set of BASH scripts that automate common developer tasks. It's intended to be included as a submodule in your project and then used as a BASH "library".

See the [documentation](https://sophie-lund.github.io/dx-scripts/) for more information.

## Setup

Bootstrap the project by running this script:

```shell
./bootstrap.bash
```

Follow the instructions printed by the script to start development.
